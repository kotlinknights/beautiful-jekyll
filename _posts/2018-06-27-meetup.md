# Topics Discussed

Round table discussion about lessons learnt since the last meetup.

* Mez shared lesson learned when converting Java to Kotlin. The java code wasn't using @nullable so a type that could be null ( in this case finger print manager on devices without fingerprint readers) was treated as @non-null and the issue/crash was only discovered during manual testing at runtime.
* Scott, mentioned about recent move to Moshi (v1.6) which uses Kotlin poet to generate pure kotlin classes under the hood - [Zac Sweers article](https://medium.com/@sweers/exploring-moshis-kotlin-code-gen-dec09d72de5e)
* Andy raised the topic of [Sealed classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html) (Enums on steroids) and Scott demoed a implementation of Sealed classes view state classes similar to that mentioned in [Craig Russel's article](https://medium.com/@trionkidnapper/issuing-commands-from-a-viewmodel-using-kotlin-sealed-classes-f1bbab7d4979)
* returning directly from if's to make code more readable
```kotlin
override fun onOptionsItemSelected(item: MenuItem?): Boolean {
       return if (item?.itemId == R.id.menu_reset) {
           restoreDefaults()
           true
       } else {
           super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)
       }
   }
```
